# Introduction
This repository contains documents introducing a new paradigm for game design. The goal of this paradigm is to create and exploring vibrant new economies. The purpose of having fun, make money, and experiment with new market designs.

The ideas explored here are naturally expressed within blockchain technology, its adjacent fields, and the cultural ethos of decentralization. The documents here are written using language from these areas. However the ideas presented here should be understood in a broader perspective that will be introduced in a future document TBD.

TLDR; you can go straight to the Potato CBG Design Doc and revisit the rest of the documents afterwards.
