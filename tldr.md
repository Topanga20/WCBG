TLDR;

We propose a new perspective for building blockchain games based on world centric game design. World centric design emphasizes game mechanics that create a dynamic and interesting world rather than game mechanics that serve the player experience. For example, the table below illustrates world-centric versions of common place game mechanics.

|  player centric mechanics |  world centric mechanics             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| replenishing resources    | finite resources                     |
| revival                   | permanent death                      |
| fast travel               | cartesian topology (no fast travel)  |
| NPC marketplaces          | player run marketplaces              |

Blockchain is an ideal environment for building world-centric games. Decentralization, self-sovreignty and code-as-law are foundational values to the platform. Thus, the blockchain game experience is ultimately driven by the emergent reality of its code rather than the intentions of its developers.

Furthermore, economies create real-world incentive to drive player decision making. Primary and secondary markets will fairly and entirely determine the value of any in game asset based solely on the collective valuation of the players. World-centric blockchain games thus translates to dynamic virtual economies that are exchangeable for and measurable in real world fiat.

In a traditional view, transactions in blockchain games are understood in-game actions. For the player, this interface is unfamiliar, expensive, and generally speaking a bad experience. Instead, we suggest understanding in-game actions as economic transactions of a rational player controlled agent. This interpretation seems promising if we consider the fact that blockchain games have yet to see mass adoption whereas decentralized exchanges are heavily used.

Finally, along side fiat-measurable assets, world-centric virtual worlds also safely generate valuable data as models for new markets with mechanism design limited only by the developer's imagination. In this regard, real world value flows into the game while innovative market driven narratives flow out. At worst, these are exciting stories for players to share; at best, these experiences might inform our real world economic policies.

We summarize the goals of world centric blockchain game design as follows:

1. To create self-sustaining economies where players compete and collaborate to grow an economically driven world narrative.
2. That these virtual worlds are dynamic, interesting and fun for players to explore.
3. To use these virtual worlds as models for radical markets with multiple agents incentivized by digital assets measurable in fiat currency.

This repository contains game design documents written with this perspective in mind. It also contains supporting documents to further elaborate the theory around world centric game design in blockchain.
