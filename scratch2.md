This document serves to introduce potato game and explains it in a new perspective for designing games as economic simulation. Since this perspective is is a natural extension of blockchain and its adjacent fields, this document presents to this specific audience. However the ideas presented here should be understood in a broader framework that will be introduced in a separate document.

In the first part, we introduce this new perspective and ground it in existing ideas of play. Then we show how we can apply to radical market simulation.

Part II is an analysis of existing blockchain games using this newly proposed framework.

The second part of this document is the potato game design document which provides a concrete example of a new closed economy built on harberger tax for private-public property ownership and quadratic voting for decentralized governance.


PART I

games as economic simulation. Virtual markets appeared

<need to define magic circle>

With digitally defined goods, there was a switch from rules to enforce the in game economy to clearly defined rules on how to break it (though we imagine under the table agreements must have happened at least once between the corrupt GM and an overly invested player in the dark recesses of someone's basement). Early MMOs are perhaps the most prominent examples. Informal both in and out of game mediated (and usually rudimentary) marketplaces for exchanging goods appeared and their norms of usage emerged. Online auction sites and discussion forums pierced the boundary enabling exchanges between the boundaries of the game and the real world. These exchanges became increasingly sophisticated and developers found new ways to combat these transactions (often through means of bans) to preserve the sanctity of their virtual worlds. Other games hope do embrace this by faciliating the transfer of assets in/out of their virtual economies. Eve online .... Second life .... .

The free 2 play era shifted perspective. Previously, time was the only out of game asset to be exchanged for in game resources. For better or for worse, "pay 2 win" is now the norm. Players can spend fiat to advance their in game state (for both single and multiplayer games). The incentives for the company is obvious and player's receive a clearly defined in game hourly wage equivalent (dependent on player skill). "if you can't beat em join em".

But f2p is a monopoly, in particular as most games restrict in game trading thus players do not own their assets. This market inefficiency is the brunt behind blockchain games.

We are not so concerned here to make an argument that this results in less fun for the player and have reason to believe the contrary. For example, we might hypothesis play these games precisely because the line between out of game and in game is blurred just enough that assets flow in to facilitate the feeling of progress and winning in game and flow in at a defined rate creating a sense of value outside the magic circle. However the blur goes only one way as assets do not flow out and very much should not flow out as it would pale in comparison to other real world opportunities (or be outcompeted be it by bots, professional gold farmers and the like). This (usually willful) illusion between in game hourly wage and out of game value on the player is the spread upon which f2p games profit.
<Games such as gambling have a long history of enticing players despite unfavorable odds>

Instead we simply suggest that an honest analysis will naturally lead to the best results in growth for this nascent industry. Providing players with better knowledge empowers them to make their own choices at the boundary of the magic circle.

Thus, in the case of blockchain games, the magic circle of virtual world is fully permeable at least in the economic sense. As we pointed out earlier, this is (for the time being) a foundational axiom for blockchain games--player ownership of items and full authority to transfer them as they please (exemplified by the fact that its equated with ERC721).

In our separate essay, we point out that permeability in the economic sense has existed for as long as multiplayer virtual world have existed. Blockchain is special in that

1. it's trustless and decentralized
2. self sovreignty necessitates and facilitates exchange of assets in/out of the blockchain (and thus the economic premeability of the virtual world defined by the blockchain)
3. it's acknowledged that decentralization and trustlessness are foundational principles in its design. And thus we might think of 2. as a corollary to 1.

From a narrative standpoint, the magic circle defines a permeable space for play and storytelling to occur. Blockchain transactions are the players' actions, and its immutable state history is its ever evolving narrative.
<write more>
<reference jean baudrillard, hard to make direct analogy though but the idea that blockchain is a simulation of real life and also facilitates an exchange with real life making them indistinguishable really pushes the point home>
We are most eager to see what narratives flow out fluxed by token permeability.

With this last point, we set the stage for what we take as our most aspirational <diff word here?> aspect of this new framework. So now we'll hypothesis what narratives flow out and what their meaning is. In the separate essay, we'll tie these ideas back in existing theoretical studies of play and games but here we'll instead provide a precise use case and illustrate it's effectiveness.

<Approaching once again from the perspective of ideas that spark interest from the blockchain community>, we take some of the ideas proposed in the radical markets as a starting point. We posit that the fully permeable economic membrane (modulo tx fees) together with the well defined scope of play within the magic circle provides a real and safe playground for experimenting with some of the radical markets outlined in the book. In particular, we will focus on the harberger tax for asset ownership and quadtratic voting for governance.

Our choice to use the harberger tax is an interesting one and this respect a radical departure from existing paradigms of game design. From a common sense stand point, it seems absurd to levy a tax on a player's assets in game. However such feelings come from a existing assumption that games must be about developing personal narratives with lasting artifacts <link to world centric design>. Survival genre games have shown that no lasting artifact is necessary and this gives more weight and freedom to the stories that are told <rewrite>

In any case, the harberger tax on blockchain is not used and it would require growing a community before it can be levied effectively creating a chicken and the egg type paradox. We're still in a hodl economy at the trailing end of growth spurned by ambitions for 1000x. Games define their own economies where value is built through play. It is less encumbered by the need for an existing economy and community to support its needs making it a good proving grounds for something like the harberger tax.

Quadratic voting is rife with problems in a pseudononymous setting where it's hard to deal with sybil attacks and bribery. For this reason, we are most excited to see how our (perhaps crude) design of quadtric voting plays out. Remember that real world polls suffer the same issue however they attempt to ensure the sanctity of their institution through laws. In practice, we need not look very far in modern politics to see where democracy has gone awry in its implementation. Again we turn towards the highly permeable and transparent membrane of the magic circle. We thus ask, what attacks will players discover and what countermeasure will the community combat. Surely there is something to be learned once an equillibrium is reached. Voting is a difficult challenge, and one we must challenge head on <link https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html>.

The closed economies of virtual worlds are fantastic playgrounds for playtesting new mechanism such as those outlined in radical markets. The permeable membrane of the virtual world allows us to measure its effects in real world currency with expermintal data flowing out. At worst, these are enticing stories told collectively in a fictional space and at best, these are lessons we might apply in spaces where consequences are more real.


<speak to how radical markets and crypto ppl vibe>

<"Crypto is a reflection of the world at large." https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html>

<examples of others things that are great test in game:
futarchy and other prediction market based decision making>
different governance models already being tested, and we think games might be a better proving grounds as they are easier to study than IRL markets especially in the volatile blockchain economy





Radical Markets

Refer to radical markets being a separate thing but drawing the interested of blockchain folx
perhaps sharing ideological roots (libertarian)
link vitalik's interest in quadtratic voting

These ideas are easy to implement on blockchain and as mentioned before, many projects have amassed sufficient usage to generate new and substantial behavioral data. However, together with successes, there been massive failures. Such projects are requried to be built on ambitions for a new economy with (naive) believers and their collataral paying the price of failure (and we have yet to see the big crash).

It's not to say such is evil, but that perhaps we should think of the permeability going both ways. As games become increasingly indistinguishable from real world economic systems perhaps real world economic systems are better considered as games. Thus a system where we play with new mechanisms (and each actors driven by their own set of values) and measure its output against our fiat economies with high accuracy.

<fun interpretation thus is that the ambition, expectations, confidence, etc of ppl in blockchain space are them performing within the magic circle (signaling what they believe to be of value or importance or however they best see fit to play), unbenknowst to themselves>




PART II


existing works analysis


<augur
decentralized governance
cryptogames (gambling, on chain owned assets (decentraland, godz unchained), cryptokitties, space commander (just do it off chain, doesn't leverage best part s of blockchani)) Make point that most games designed aren't leveraging permeable boundary of on-chain virtual world magic circle. Too many games trying to bring existing mechanics that are either upgraded (or downgraded) by blockchain such as godz unchained and space commander. Cryptokitties was interesting and a good prototype for potential of blockchain games but no closed economy and thus no real virtual world. Gambling certainly embraces the permeable boundary (arguably no boundary) but only a more efficient version of a well established field. Existing ponzi scheme types games are worth analyzing in their own right (in particular, comparing with incremental game genre + permeable boundary) as a fascinating (and sad) social phoenemena which arguable might be a good entry point into the fomo undercurrent of ICO boom but outside the scope of this author.>


Our first remark is to say that existing blockchain projects, such as prediction markets (Augur), DAOs (too many to list) and DEXs (way too many to list) share many similarities with games. Their primary difference is that the assets are assumed to be part of the real world. We can squint are eyes until the permeable boundary between real and virtual worlds dissapears and then these examples really look no different. We can also shift are perspective and add boundaries to these projects. DEXs work with on chain assets many of which are economically coherent on their own.. DAOs can be designed to govern the rules and economics of play which you will see is exactly what we do in our proposed game. Prediction markets rely on the efficient market hypothesis to accurately gauge any real world sentiment which can also be applied to games and storytelling. Indeed blockchain itself can be viewed as a immensely successful game. In this respect, "blockchain game" it it's limited interpretation (which this article aims to expand) is not so problematic as the full expression is already encompassed by the blockchain ecosystem already.

Things that are presently viewed as blockchain games, on the other hand, do not fully leverage the permeable boundary of on-chain virtual worlds. It is the author's view that, at the time of writing (2019) too many projects approach the space by taking existing games and upgrading (or downgrading) them to use blockchain. With this view, we split games into roughly 2 categories:

1. on-chain assets, off-chain gameplay - directly addressing centralization and privacy concerns of increasingly valuable virtual worlds, games like godz unchained and decentralized entrust asset management to blockchain. This is a promising if not already proven endeavor. Players will trade their assets one way or another so why not give them ownership? For developers, this avoids needing to manage one owns assets and focus on generating new assets of value. Such efforts are still new
For example, will out of print and overpowered on-chain CCG cards ever fetch black lotus prices? Only time will tell.

2. Gambling on chain certainly embraces the permeable boundary (arguably no boundary). It is also a well established and efficient field and this author doubts that trustlessness is adds anything substantial to traditional gambling tropes. Existing ponzi scheme types games are worth analyzing in their own right. They share many similarities with the incremental game genre yet mapping to real world assets changes them entirely. It is a fascinating (and sad) social phoenemena which arguable might be a good entry point into understanding the FOMO undercurrent of ICO boom. This perspective is no so different than the thesis of this essay and is also outside the scope of this author.

where as a centralized implementation for cryptokitties is indeed possible, the on chain breeding mechanics and auction markets captured the decentralized spirit of blockchain. Asset ownership and gameplay came hand in hand.

cryptospace commander

<Cryptokitties -> Ethereum mainnet slowdown -> often cited as
 potential of blockchain games and need for scalability>
cryptokitties predecessor of a true blockchain game
shortcomings:
-easy breeding meant low value to non gen 0 kitties
  -even special kitties are not so unique
-no closed economic loop for extended value generation
  -eventual loss of interest reduce value of even special and gen 0 kitties
  -economy reliant on outside participation
-TBH kind of a ponzi scheme
To be clear, cryptokitties is a very succesful blockchain games and by examining areas where it fell short (long term value) we can push the boundary further and innovate.







PART III

<link design doc>






----------



This document examines a new framework for designing games that exists at the intersection of games and economics.
This framework enables a new class of games that we believe are possible to deploy in practice in large part because of the recent growth of blockchain.
Using this framework, valuable socioeconomic experiments can be conducted in a space with real value and only fictional effects.
At the end of this document, we introduce potato game, which is working design document for a game that is a direct application of this new framework.




Salen and Zimmerman writes, "In a very basic sense, the magic circle of a game is where the game takes place. To play a game means entering into a magic circle, or perhaps creating one as a game begins." As noted by many game theorist, the magic circle has always been permeable with "real world" factors seeping in and out of the game both through informal outside engagements and through formal institutions like virtual market places.

In this new framework, the magic circle is but a vestigial frame that is but a starting point for making meaning. Whereas each player may create their own relation with the circle, it's understood and accepted that the circle does not restrict player in a

In blockchain space, the magic circle might be analogous to altruism. Such actors do exist along side with byzantine and rational actors.
