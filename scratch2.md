This document serves to introduce potato game and explains it in a new framework for designing games as economic simulation. Since this framework is easy to implement and interpret in blockchain its applications in many adjacent fields, this document presents to the audience. However the ideas presented here should be understood in a broader framework that will be introduced in a separate document that also explores its relation with blockchain.

In the first part, we introduce this framework from a blockchain perspective, analyze existing projects, and show how we can apply to radical market simulation.

The second part of this document is the potato game design document which provides a concrete example of a new closed economy built on harberger tax for private-public property ownership and quadratic voting for decentralized governance.


PART I

games as economic simulation. Virtual markets appeared

With digitally defined goods, there was a switch from rules to enforce the in game economy to clearly defined rules on how to break it (though we imagine under the table agreements must have happened at least once between the corrupt GM and an overly invested player in the dark recesses of someone's basement). Early MMOs are perhaps the most prominent examples. Informal both in and out of game mediated (and usually rudimentary) marketplaces for exchanging goods appeared and their norms of usage emerged. Online auction sites and discussion forums pierced the boundary enabling exchanges between the boundaries of the game and the real world. These exchanges became increasingly sophisticated and developers found new ways to combat these transactions (often through means of bans) to preserve the sanctity of their virtual worlds. Other games hope do embrace this by faciliating the transfer of assets in/out of their virtual economies. Eve online .... Second life .... .

the free 2 play era shifted perspective. For better or for worse, players can "pay 2 win" to advance within their virtual worlds (for both single and multiplayer games).  "if you can't beat em join em"

blockchain games is all about the frictionless premeability of magic circle of virtual worlds...

Radical Markets

Refer to radical markets being a separate thing but drawing the interested of blockchain folx
perhaps sharing ideological roots (libertarian)
link vitalik's interest in quadtratic voting

These ideas are easy to implement on blockchain and as mentioned before, many projects have amassed sufficient usage to generate new and substantial behavioral data. However, together with successes, there been massive failures. Such projects are requried to be built on ambitions for a new economy with (naive) believers and their collataral paying the price of failure (and we have yet to see the big crash).

It's not to say such is evil, but that perhaps we should think of the permeability going both ways. As games become increasingly indistinguishable from real world economic systems perhaps real world economic systems are better considered as games. Thus a system where we play with new mechanisms (and each actors driven by their own set of values) and measure its output against our fiat economies with high accuracy.

<fun interpretation thus is that the ambition, expectations, confidence, etc of ppl in blockchain space are them performing within the magic circle (signaling what they believe to be of value or importance or however they best see fit to play), unbenknowst to themselves>





PART II

<link design doc>






----------



This document examines a new framework for designing games that exists at the intersection of games and economics.
This framework enables a new class of games that we believe are possible to deploy in practice in large part because of the recent growth of blockchain.
Using this framework, valuable socioeconomic experiments can be conducted in a space with real value and only fictional effects.
At the end of this document, we introduce potato game, which is working design document for a game that is a direct application of this new framework.




Salen and Zimmerman writes, "In a very basic sense, the magic circle of a game is where the game takes place. To play a game means entering into a magic circle, or perhaps creating one as a game begins." As noted by many game theorist, the magic circle has always been permeable with "real world" factors seeping in and out of the game both through informal outside engagements and through formal institutions like virtual market places.

In this new framework, the magic circle is but a vestigial frame that is but a starting point for making meaning. Whereas each player may create their own relation with the circle, it's understood and accepted that the circle does not restrict player in a

In blockchain space, the magic circle might be analogous to altruism. Such actors do exist along side with byzantine and rational actors.
