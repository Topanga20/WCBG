:: visual style notes ::
game loop:
animals/land -> jobs -> potatoes -(buy)-> animals/land
                                 -(trade)-> tech/resources
                     -> tech -(improve)-> jobs
                     -> resources -(upgrade)-> animals/land
animals/land -(tax)-> government -> funding/policies
     animal -(vote)->

Ecology:
land -(based on policy)-> jobs -(based on tech)-> ecology -> land
land -(recovers)-> ecology

UI:
animal/land marketplace
job interface (employer/employee)
resource marketplace interface
  examples of different resources/tech graphics
governance interface
animal
  illustrate different traits
land
  illustrate different traits
  illustrate ecology?
corporation
  list of land/animals
  resources owned

Concept:
emergent player run/owned economy
player experience is like trading stocks but less boring
playgrounds for new market mechanisms
immediate goal: player driven narratives based on real world economics
ultimate goal: more just future using equitable market mechanisms

real world -(capital/players)-> potato game growth -(stories/lessons)-> real world

Player Experience:
Invest: Purchase animals and land and set prices to secure your investment.
<the harbeger tax system creates a unique unprecedented ownership experience>
<ui of land/animal marketplace + personal land/assets + recent sales>
Work (profit?): Employ or be Employed to generate goods and services
<animal happily working on land and generating revenue>
<ui showing which animals are working where and how much they are generating>
Develop: Build infrastructure, research new technology, develop animals
<upgrade land with hydroponic garden, show effects in reducing emissions/save water>
Trade: exchange goods at their market value
<ui of marketplace trading potatoes for windmill>
Govern: propose and vote on policies that control the regulate labor and monetary parameters for the entire game.
<ui of proposal to set carbon tax and current votes>
quadratic voting creates a unique player governed game world
Shape the World: The game world is living and responds to your actions. Exploit and deplete its resources for short term gain or collaborate to create a long term sustainable economy.

Total Experience
Triangle: Compete <-> Collaborate <-> Stories: What world will players choose to create and what lessons will they learn?





:: Job land ::
-?? total land avail is inverse function of flora (number of jobs possible)
-agriculture ideal stats: sun, rain, humidity, topology, temp
  -output is scaled based on sqrt(sum of square differences of ideal and land stats)

:: Job animal ::
-quadratic growth until stat requirement is met, logarithmic or sqrt growth afterwards

-output
  -2x favors strength
-energy efficiency
  -2x favors intel
-resource efficiency
  -2x favors dex
  -effects fertility and resource depletion

ecology - job specific, can be reduced by combination of energy/resource efficiency
pleasure - job specific? maybe if output can be compared to avg productivity/animal then you get job expertise pride points.

-animal stats
  -strength
  -intelligence
  -cuteness
  -dexterity
-job output properties
  -output (amount produced)
  -energy efficiency (energy spent)
  -resource efficiency (natural resource consumed)
  -ecology (carbon emission and land damage)
  -pleasure (animal happiness)

Theory of play and the magic circle

blockchain as a new platform for play

economics and play


----------


Introduction:
blockchain is paradigm shifting platform for games (maybe move later so it's not another blockchain paper...)
A new economic platform
economic simulation and play
potato game 2 - QV + harberger tax (libertarian socialism?)

introduction to blockchain (trustless, economics, etc)

traditional games analysis?
game economics
breaking boundary of external/internal game economies (break magic circle)
embracing this (eve online example)

adding blockchain to games
cryptokitties case study - sucess/short comings
other existing types of games - on chain ownership + ponzi schemes
argue that token exchanges may be a type of game, see breaking boundary of magic circle

finally introduce potato game
closed economic circle
blockchain and self sovreign nature means no magic circle boundary
yet still safe I hope, at least in the sense that we wont be making potato game asics and no second morgages to buy potatoes in order to play
radical markets
economic efficiency of COST and democratic efficiency of QV
but does it really work?
is economic growth the only goal (it is in the case of potato game, as empty as it is IRL)
simulate externalities, see which wins
revisit idea of goals of a game in classical games analysis/game theory
safe part is that you agree on the goal when you enter the circle, or at least the rules of play are explicit or something like that



radical market simulation

paradigm shifting technology is incommensurable. It follows games built on such technology requires a new framework to understand it. Game mechanics may break game design common sense in the prior framework of understanding.

We'll start by examining cryptokitties in this new framework to see its success and shortcomings
-----------------
::TODO::
-finish marketplace
-finish job compat
-finish ecology
-add service jobs
-add diet upgrades
-figure out how to do research
  -build research tree

::fertilizer cycle::
-fauna/diversity -> fertility -> more fauna/diversity
-fertility -> higher output
-fauna/diversity -> less land -> lower output
-fertilizer -> substitutes fertility
-fertilizer available from mining + manufacturing

::ecology::
-C02
  -reduces naturally over time at a <???> rate dependent on amount of natural flora
-natural flora
  -increases at a <???> rate over time dependent on C02 and topsoil quality?
-pollution
  -decreases very very slowly over time?
  -use logarithmic scale as increase productivity means increased pollution probs
-season (X blocks = 1 year)
  -globally effect temperature
  -may effect rainfall etc..

::market place::
-XYK vs LMSR vs buy/sell order marketplace
-cost
  -taxation on goods in potatoes, can be voted for
  -CO2 emission for transporting stuff to/from market place
  -easy version: fixed potatoes per unit weight of goods sent to/from the marketplace
  -hard version: see transportation
-for local market places, who pays for initial liquidity?

::research::
-multi team research projects (all research prereqs must be satisfied)
  -all animals earn research goal
-teaching session where research is shared?

::governance::
-research existing QV schemes?
  -https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656
  -https://csap.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/qrmw_gw_2-16-17.pdf
-I think having a proposal period every X blocks where up to Y proposals move onto voting preiod.
  -You can vote for proposals to rank them during the proposal period.

::income and sales tax::
???

::implementation questions::
DONE-granularity of lazy update tracking. i.e. should jobs be tracked separately
  -currently the answer is no but seems like it may be gas cost prohibitive to do update land if it needs to update all jobs which then needs to update all animals
  -e.g.
    -animal
      -normal update (metabolism)
      -job
      -tax
    -land
      -normal update (ecology)
      -jobs
      -tax


::other ideas::
-small reward for updating other people's stuff
  -scales on number of blocks
  -bonus if tax liability exceeds total amount (to reduce burden on others)
-insurance for failure to pay salary
-severance pay for removing animals from work
-GDP calculator
-SoL requirements (e.g. animals must be be fed a sufficiently good diet)
-potato deposit for making proposals, refunded if enough votes
  -?? finders fee for proposing proposals that pass?
-number of votes needed for policy to pass
-discrimination laws
-corporation action points
  -to discourage mega accounts that avoid taxes, corporations have action points that limit how much they can do in a day
-harberger tax for voice credits
  -pricing structure that discourages accumulating too many votes?
-voice credits per block can be voted on :)

::future ideas::
-housing rent and non trivial topology
  -housing: land can develop a number of housing units
    -better housing = better energy recovery
    -affinity: longer an animal stays in place better recovery from housing (up to a cap)
  -transportation
    -animal must commute to work, further the commute, more energy consumed
    -animal must commute to see service providers
  -transportation of goods
    -how to pay for transportation of goods?
    -local markets
  -public transport, roads etc.
  -marketplaces
    -can be built by players, upgraded etc..
    -transportation based on distance to market
-animal lifecycle
  -animal reproduction and reproduction laws?
  -animal death
-animal loyalty
  -in particular, I want a U shaped curve with two equillibriums on either side so that distrusting animals will exploit you if you try to get them to trust you
  -and loyalty should be a tragedy of the commons sort of thing, so that if all players treat their animals well and one doesn't, that one player will profit more.
