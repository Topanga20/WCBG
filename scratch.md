## Introduction

<P2CBG is a game that exists at the intersection of Play, Blockchain and Economics. Borrowing from the structure of numerous aspirational cryptocurrency whitepapers, this document starts with an aspirational picture of blockchain games and their potential. We outline some key differences of this new ludo-financial decentralized platform and describe a new lens to understand how to design games on it. The second section is the design document itself>

econ simulation (radical markets: QV, harberger tax)
blockchain
play (collecting cute animals)

make a point that blockchain games are a new breed and the possibilities of expression have not yet been imagined.

<Cryptokitties -> Ethereum mainnet slowdown -> often cited as
 potential of blockchain games and need for scalability>
cryptokitties predecessor of a true blockchain game
shortcomings:
-easy breeding meant low value to non gen 0 kitties
  -even special kitties are not so unique
-no closed economic loop for extended value generation
  -eventual loss of interest reduce value of even special and gen 0 kitties
  -economy reliant on outside participation
-TBH kind of a ponzi scheme
To be clear, cryptokitties is a very succesful blockchain games and by examining areas where it fell short (long term value) we can push the boundary further and innovate.

For a game, Play goes without saying.
<huizingha/callois qutose> -> blur line between play and IRL economics with F2P/P2W microtransactions and online markets for in game assets -> new forms of play. New purpose of play
<can we incorporate bateson, theory of play and fantasy here and somehow tie into simulating radical markets?>

in game assets -> F2P -> microtransactions
              -> MMOs -> online markets
blurring the line between play economics and IRL economics
<cite huizinha/callois>
embrace the blurred boundary


## Summary

<prob move to end>
Cleary Potato Game has grim undertones of a capitalist nightmare. Animals are bought and sold based on their potential for economic output (read: slave labor). This is surprising coming from a stark socialist/anarchist like myself. However I too am a product of capitalism and games create a safe space to play out violent libertarian fantasies. Yet the emergent reality is impartial of design and intent. Perhaps in this world, we realize the libertarian dream. Without agency or freedom, Potato Land is efficiently developed by the invisible hand. Animals grow and come to a higher standard of living. At the end of the day, these are all stories. It's up to the player to interpret them.
