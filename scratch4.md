# Future Applications

The design documents in this repository demonstrate how world-centric blockchain games might incorporate the Harberger tax and quadratic voting. We chose to highlight these mechanism as they are are both promising and straightforward to design. In this last section, we highlight just some other mechanisms that we think are  ready to integrate into a world-centric game.

- Outsourcing labor and risk: Since we expect there to be many world-centric blockchain games each with their own unique dynamic economy that might have very different values. Cross-game bridges can be built and governed between the two chains allowing each game to outsource labor and risk to the other one. This abstract reduction of capitalism, ethics and law, might inform us about the present situation of our global economy.

- Futarchy: We believe games are the best place to effectively playtest prediction markets for governance (futarchy). This is especially good for safety as futarchy has no obvious implementation and is understood under hypothetical conditions (moreover, the EMH assures an accurate measure of probability and not well-being).

# Existing Work

Whereas the explicit viewpoint of blockchain as a playground for world-centric game design to generate data on new economic mechanism is new, the practice of such is in fact not. Interleaving each new chain and ICO token is a complex dynamic emergent web of new relations that play out like a game. Each chain or exchange is a portal into this world. Each whitepaper is like a character sheet outlining what role the organization will play. Each enthusiast, developer, trader or investor is an independent agent trying to collaborate, and compete in the space.

This is why we feel confident that this is presently the best angle for games to grow constructively into the space of blockchain. If blockchain is indeed the paradigm shifting technology it purports to be, its applications themselves must be incommensurable with the existing understanding.
